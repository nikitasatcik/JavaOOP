   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Use OOP features: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
 * Each class must have a comprehensive meaningful name and informative composition.
 * Inheritance should be used only when it makes sense.
 * Coding should use java code convention.
 * Classes must be intelligently packaged.
 * Console operation or console menus should be minimal.
 * You can use files to store initialization parameters.
